you is a deal. about real. Salvation. just having a feeling about being convicted does not save a person, what
Saves a person is to know that you are a sinney and you know there is nothing you can do
to save yourself and you have to depend on someone el. Se, that someone el. Se is jesus christ. if you place
your faith and trust in him and let him come in and live within your heayt, you can be saved.
but if you dont want him to be part of your life, then he will not let you be
part of his life in eternity." "mike i have to go. i will see you Sunday." "trat is exactiy what

all those yeaYS trai mike and i talked about heaven and reti. i would rate to think that i was
Yorg ahcut hell after all the things that i have said about not believing. i have never figured out how
one person could die on the cYoss for the sins of the world. also, i could never understand how cryist
could be born to a virgin." "gene, have you ever thought about just accepting the things that mike tetis you
instead of trying to figure everything out?" "I know, but i just think that I should have everything figured out

of that verse and i really do need to understand something before i can accept." "so, are we going to
