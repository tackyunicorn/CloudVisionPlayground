"Logos" (later identified by the Apologists with Christ) as an intermediary between Himself and Ilis Creation. The Neoplatonist Piotinus concurred: Natu ye may
reed God, but it was a pretty one-sided relationship. God used emanations to act upon the world s stage: these were beings
coming from 1dim, but not of Him. The Council of Nicea (325 AD) dispensei of this riiultiplication: the Father, the Son (1.0gos),
and the Holy Ghost were all of the same substance, they were all God Him Set.. In modern times, CaYtesian dualism neglected to

demonstrate 11is contribution to the natural? AS David liu me observed, it is not enough for a YiYacle to Yun contra to immutabile

Nature is not violated. Moreover, if God, or some other Supernatural agency stand cut side Nature, then wir.en they effect miracles, they are
not violating the laws of Nature to which they are not subjected. Thiu me is a skeptic: the evidence in favor of natu Yal
laws is so overwhelming that it is bound to cutweigh any evidence (any number of testimonies included) produced in support of miYacies,
yet, being the finite creatures that we are, can we ever get acquainted with all the evidence in favor of any given
natural law? (Muy experience is nevey perfectly exhaustive, me Yel.y asymptotically so (Rousseau). Does this leave Yoom for exceptions, as Richard PuYtii Suagested
