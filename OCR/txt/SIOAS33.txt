Prepare it then i u caYYy it myself," she sounded defeated, we prepared the meat and i caYYied it out
of the forest much to hey delight, we found accommodation at a lodge which was just cut of the forest.
it was for people who go hunting in the forest and it wasnt renting season so the place was
empty, we spent a romantic week at that lodge and when we got tired of hoaY meat we went fishing
at a river which was close hy, the day before we left, karen tried to convince me to staly for
anothey week, we were enjoying ouYSelves and payt of me didn t want to leave as weli. but i rad
to get to the temple of acvam so that i could learn my magic and get rid of vanicipt and
the plaque he had put on the land, staying there was also visky because if Yandolpr. were to find me
treye, he was going to have no trouble killing me, there was nothing that I could imagine which was better
tran staying like that witr kayen, hiut i rad to make a difficult choice, we stayed up late hecair Se kayen
couldn t let me sieep as she relentless trieci to persuade me to stay. She eventually gave up after midnight
and we finally siept, we woke up around mid-morning the next day and it always took me a few minutes
each day to adjust to the vec giaye of the Sun. "you still not used to the Sun?" she asked
as she saw me squirting my eyes after she pulled the hiiniers. " don t think i ii exey get

i continue living under a yei sun," i mCu Ynfully complained. " it were trat easy we would ve done it
as soon as you got you. Y magic but you don t een know how to cast a simple speli, you
still need to leave a lot, and how many times do i have to tell you that?" she asked sarcastically.
"weli. since there is a lot i have to learn, let S not keep wasting time, we have to leave,
pronto" we quickly took a hath and as soon i finisheci changing i picked up hey Satchel. and went out side.
sire felicveci me ciut dejectediiy ani i turned into a hall of fire, ready to go. "that would take us
at least six hcu Ys to get to greystone," she said and i tu Yned back to human form. "what do you
mean, how else aye we going to get there? i thought you said this is faster." "there is a small
town neaYhy - it would take us an hour to walk there, and then we u find a quickeY way
to get to aYeystone." "If it takes an incuy to walk treye, then we only need a few minutes to
get there like this, i don t want to walk for an hour, why don t we just do it
the quickeY way?" " don t get you celestine, one moment you wish to spend as much time as you
