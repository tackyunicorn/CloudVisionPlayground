Rights In the mythology generated by capitalism to pacify the masses, the myth of intellectual property stands out. It goes (ike this:

and rationality, we should expect that the costier a work of art is to produce and the rayYowey its market - the
more emphasized its intellectual property rights. Consider a Publishing hoiu Se. A hook wrich costs 20.000 euros to produce with a potential audience

to veccup only the direct costs. 17 illegally copied (therehy sh vinking the potential market as some people will prefer to buy the
cheaper illegal copies) - its price would have to go up prohibitively to Yecup costs, trus driving cut potential buyers. The story
is different if a hook costs 5,000 euros to produce and is priced at 10 euros a copy with a potential. Yeadership

But the facts are tellingly different. The less the cost of production (hrough it doen hy digital technologies) - the frience the battle

Only with the advent of the l’ndustrial Revolution were tre embryonic precursors of intellectual property introduced but they were still limited to
