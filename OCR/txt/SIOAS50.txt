it the more Yugged, the more terrible, the more desolate did it appear. Would they he ahle to find a
place to land, or would they go huyting down into some awful cYatey, or he dashed upon the sharp peak
of some mountain of the moon? it was a momentous question, and anxious were the faces of the two professoYS.
"MY. renderson, if you will undertake to steer to some level place, i will take charge of the motor," Suggested
MY. You mann. "i Li. Yadually reduce the speed, and get the Yepelling machine in readiness, so as to render city
Landina gentle." "very well," Yesponded tre aged Scientist, as he Yasperi tre steering wheel, the progress of tre annihilator was
ayadually checked. more and more slowly it aPpYoacred the moon, the mountains seemed even highey now, and tire craters deeper.
"wrat a terrible place," mir Ymir Yerd jack. " srculin i want to live treye." "me eitrey," said mark. "can you see
a place to land?" called professor You mann tr Yough the speaking-tihe from the engine room to the steering towey. "ves, we
seem to be approaching a faixiy level. platear," was my. renderson s Yepi.y. "very weli, tren, i ti start the
Yepelling machine." tre caviite motor was stopped, the projectile was now being drawn toward the moon by the gravity Force
of the dead bali that once had been a woyid like CuYS, Siowi.y and more si.owly moved the great pyojectile.
there was a moment of Suspense, my, henderson tir Yew over the steering wheel, the annihilator moved more Sioely, then came
a gentle shock. the dishes in the gallery Yattied, and there was the clank of machinery, the strangrai Yooster crowed.
"we Ye on the moon at last!" CYieci jack, peering from an observation window at the Yugged surface outside. "yes;
and now to see what its like," added mark. "we u ao outside, and ----" "Wait," cautioned professor You mann. "First
we must see if we can hyeatre on the moon, and whether the temperature Mill. Support Ufe, i riu St make
some tests hefore we venture out of the projectile." the natural. inclination of the boys to Yush out on the
SvYface of the moon to see what it was like was checked by the words of caution from professor You mann.
"do you think it would be dangerous to venture outside the projectile?" asked jack, as he looked from the aindow)
and noted the Yuaaed, uneven surface of the moon. "very much so," was the answer. "according to most astronomers, there
is absolutely no air on the moon, also no moisture, and the temperature is either very high or around the
Freezing point, we must find out what it is." "how can we?" inquirei mark. " u soon show you," weni
on the geyman. "professor henderson, ill. yciu kindly assist me." er en it had been decided to come to the moon
in quest for tre field of diamonds, certain charges rai heen made in the annihilator to fit it for new
conditions trat might he met, one of these con sisted of an apeytin Ye in the two sides of tre projectile peYmitting
certain delicate instruments to be trust out, so trat tre conditions they indicated could he Yeai on dials or graduated
Scales from within, "we will first make a test of the temperature," said YmY. You mann, "as trat avili. he the
easiest." accordingly a thermometer was put outside, and those in the air-craft anxiou Sy watched the red column of Spirits, the
temperatu Ye was marked as Seventy-five inside tre annihilator, bir i tre treymometey had not heen Cutside more than a second before

it too cold tran too hot, we can stand a minus Afty of cold better tran two hundred and twelve
of heat, we have fuYaaYments with us." "it is still going down," vema Yked jack, as he saw tre veci
column irop down past the thirty mark. "hel.ow freezing," added mark. the spirits Feli, in the tube until they touched
twenty-eight degrees, and there they Yemained. "twenty-eight degrees," yemarked professor henderson, "trat isn t so hari, at least, we can
stand that if we are warmi.ciari." "yes, but it will be colder to-night," said jack. for they had landed
on the moon in h right sunlight. "to-night?" questioned the german Scientist, with a smile. "Yes, it S always colder when
the sun goes down," went on the lad. "you have forgotten one thing," said mv. henderson, with a smile at
his young protã©nã©. "you must remember, jack, that the nights and days here are each fou Yteen days iong--that is, fcu Yteen
of ouy days." "rows that?" asked jack. "why," hroke in mark, who was a tifie hetter student than was
his cruri, "don t you remember that the moon rotates on its axis once a month, or in about twenty-eight
days, to be exact, and so half of that time is day and half night, just as on ou y earth,
when it revolves on its axis in twenty-four hou Ys, half the time is day and half the time is right."
"Su Ye, i cuart to have yemembered," declared jack. "mark is right," added my. renderson, "and, as we have most fortunately
ayyived on the moon at the beginning of the long day, we will have fou Yteen days of Sunshine, du ving which
we may expect the temperature to remain at about twenty-eight degrees, but now about the atmosphere." "we saili test that
directly," went on the geyman. "it will take some time iongey, trcuar." Navicius instruments were hycugir i feytir and trust cut
