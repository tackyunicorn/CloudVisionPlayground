the financial theories we use to determine the value of shares were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when diridenis
were in vogue. They invariably relied on a few implicit and explicit assiumptions: 1. That the fair "value" of a share is

A disccuri Yate is applied to the stream of all future income Yom the share - i.e., its dividends. What should this
